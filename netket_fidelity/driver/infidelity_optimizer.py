        Constructs a driver training the state to match the target state.

        The target state is either `math`:\ket{\psi}` or `math`:\hat{U}\ket{\psi}`
        depending on the provided inputs.

        Operator I_op computing the infidelity I among two variational states |ψ⟩ and |Φ⟩ as:

        .. math::

            I = 1 - |⟨ψ|Φ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ⟨Φ|Φ⟩ = 1 - ⟨ψ|I_op|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩

        where:

         .. math::

            I_op = |Φ⟩⟨Φ| / ⟨Φ|Φ⟩

        The state |Φ⟩ can be an autonomous state |Φ⟩ =|ϕ⟩ or an operator U applied to it, namely
        |Φ⟩  = U|ϕ⟩. I_op is defined by the state |ϕ⟩ (called target) and, possibly, by the operator U.
        If U is not passed, it is assumed |Φ⟩ =|ϕ⟩.

        The Monte Carlo estimator of I is:

        ..math::

            I = \mathbb{E}_{χ}[ I_loc(σ,η) ] = \mathbb{E}_{χ}[ ⟨σ|Φ⟩ ⟨η|ψ⟩ / ⟨σ|ψ⟩ ⟨η|Φ⟩ ]

        where χ(σ, η) = |Ψ(σ)|^2 |Φ(η)|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ⟨Φ|Φ⟩. In practice, since I is a real quantity, Re{I_loc(σ,η)}
        is used. This estimator can be utilized both when |Φ⟩ =|ϕ⟩ and when |Φ⟩ = U|ϕ⟩, with U a (unitary or
        non-unitary) operator. In the second case, we have to sample from U|ϕ⟩ and this is implemented in
        the function :ref:`jax.:ref:`InfidelityUPsi`. This works only with the operators provdided in the package.
        We remark that sampling from U|ϕ⟩ requires to compute connected elements of U and so is more expensive
        than sampling from an autonomous state. The choice of this estimator is specified by passing
        `sample_Upsi=True`, while the flag argument `is_unitary` indicates whether U is unitary or not.

        If U is unitary, the following alternative estimator can be used:

        ..math::

            I = \mathbb{E}_{χ'}[ I_loc(σ,η) ] = \mathbb{E}_{χ}[ ⟨σ|U|ϕ⟩ ⟨η|ψ⟩ / ⟨σ|U^{\dagger}|ψ⟩ ⟨η|ϕ⟩ ].

        where χ'(σ, η) = |Ψ(σ)|^2 |ϕ(η)|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩. This estimator is more efficient since it does not
        require to sample from U|ϕ⟩, but only from |ϕ⟩. This choice of the estimator is the default and it works only
        with `is_unitary==True` (besides `sample_Upsi=False`). When |Φ⟩ = |ϕ⟩ the two estimators coincides.

        To reduce the variance of the estimator, the Control Variates (CV) method can be applied. This consists
        in modifying the estimator into:

        ..math::

            I_loc^{CV} = Re{I_loc(σ,η)} - c (|1 - I_loc(σ,η)^2| - 1)

        where c ∈ \mathbb{R}. The constant c is chosen to minimize the variance of I_loc^{CV} as:

        ..math::

            c* = Cov_{χ}[ |1-I_loc|^2, Re{1-I_loc}] / Var_{χ}[ |1-I_loc|^2 ],

        where Cov[..., ...] indicates the covariance and Var[...] the variance. In the relevant limit
        |Ψ⟩ →|Φ⟩, we have c*→-1/2. The value -1/2 is adopted as default value for c in the infidelity
        estimator. To not apply CV, set c=0.

        Args:
            target_state: target variational state |ϕ⟩.
            optimizer: the optimizer to use to use (from optax)
            variational_state: the variational state to train
            U: operator U.
            U_dagger: dagger operator U^{\dagger}.
            cv_coeff: Control Variates coefficient c.
            is_unitary: flag specifiying the unitarity of U. If True with `sample_Upsi=False`, the second estimator is used.
            dtype: The dtype of the output of expectation value and gradient.
            sample_Upsi: flag specifiying whether to sample from |ϕ⟩ or from U|ϕ⟩. If False with `is_unitary=False`, an error occurs.
            preconditioner: Determines which preconditioner to use for the loss gradient.
                This must be a tuple of `(object, solver)` as documented in the section
                `preconditioners` in the documentation. The standard preconditioner
                included with NetKet is Stochastic Reconfiguration. By default, no
                preconditioner is used and the bare gradient is passed to the optimizer.
